I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Physics at the University of Michigan, working under the supervision of [Prof. Emanuel Gull](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/gull-lab/). My research focuses on developing new quantum many-body techniques, with a recent emphasis on analytic continuation using the minimal information principle in the complex pole representation.

Before joining the University of Michigan, I earned my bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2019, where I conducted research under the supervision of [Prof. Youjin Deng](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yjdeng/). During my undergraduate studies, my focus was on developing novel Monte Carlo algorithms for classical statistical models.

**I am preparing to apply for postdoctoral positions in Fall 2025 and would greatly appreciate any advice or opportunities.**
